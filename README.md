# A Tensorflow Implementation of Embedding Compressor
## Requirements
- Numpy
- Tensorflow >=1.3

## Notes
- This is an implementation of "COMPRESSING WORD EMBEDDINGS VIA DEEP COMPOSITIONAL CODE LEARNING (ICLR, 2018)".
- I tried to implement this paper for understanding the paper and personal practice of Tensorflow, based on the original writer's codes even though the original codes are well-constructed and easy to understand :)
- The original codes: [nncompress: Implementations of Embedding Quantization (Compress Word Embeddings)](https://github.com/zomux/neuralcompressor "")
